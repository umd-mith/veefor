Teachers were in attendance. Jake and Bettye Queen were organizers for the event; their home was used as the address 1422 5th Street Glenarden, Maryland. \n\nClass Newsletter from October 1996 includes President's Message from William Wright. William Wright was a Lakeland High School classmate and President; like Jake and Bettye Queen, he was instrumental in organizing events. Secretary Edda Marshall was \"a bundle of fun\" and \"an excellent teacher [in Prince George's County]. She taught special education. She kept excellent notes... she could always go back and reflect on what we were thinking.\" Her husband, Michael Marshall, wasn't a part of the last class but was very involved with her because they lived in Fairmont Heights. Treasury Report Helen Prather-Duvall was an \"excellent person with the finances.\" Dolores Burrow-Brevard was also instrumental in helping. Officers are listed on the front, scholarship recipients are listed in the centerfold. Arthur Dock was parliamentarian, in charge of ensuring the guidelines were being followed. Rev. Rodney L Young was chapman. Page 3 has a note from the Health & Welfare Committee, Reader Spotlight. Newsletters were distributed every 6 months; Bettye Queen and Edda Marshall was mainly in charge.\n\nEdgar A Smith Scholarship Application copy. Edgar A. Smith had a son and daughter. James Chittams wanted to design a book on him, but didn't get cooperation from the family.  \n\nLakeland Newsletter, winter edition (no year listed, possibly 1991). Includes a letter for the president mentioning the Las Vegas trip, information about the scholarship. Betty and Sterling Queen are listed as contact people. Final page announces Winter Dance on Dec 1 1991 at the residence of Mr and Mrs. William Wright in Glenarden. Quarterly meetings listed for follow-ups/recap of trips; to add an item to the meeting agenda, classmates called Jake Queen or the President. \n\nLetterhead from Lakeland High School. Rodney Young designed the letterhead and wanted to \"keep it simple.\" The lamp of knowledge served as a symbol for the last class. \n\nMeeting Minutes from Dec 17, 1999; penned in Mrs. Bettye Queen's penmanship. \"Whatever she did she did well, she was a great leader.\" Agenda items include treasurer report  and scholarship report. Lists January 8 as 50th year in ministry; church on Wheeler Road. More than half the class went to a hotel in Oxen Hill to celebrate. Dues were collected from classmates to fund activities; advertisements were also placed in local newspapers to promote the last class' activities. Glenarden, Laurel, and Lakeland all had strong American Legion chapters and were avid advertising partnership. Lakeland Hall on Rhode Island Ave. housed Lakeland's American Legion Chapter and the House of Ruth, a religious organization. They used to hold poetry recitals for youth, because \"poetry makes you think.\" Spiritual hymns were also vital.",

School desegregation impacted the group of recipients. \n\nEdgar A. Smith Scholarship Application used to vet applications. Individuals from the last class served on sub-committees for the creation of application and to reviewers of applications. \n\n\"Jake\" Sterling Queen was the individual driving force and organizer for the Edgar A.

This copy is the highest quality original copy available in its full/complete form. Whenever possible, original audiovisual formats (WAV, WMA, etc) were retained. In cases where a cleaned audio file was created, it was exported as an uncompressed WAV file. Any additional oral history audiovisual files from this range of dates, including subparts of an interview which was originally fragmented, and uncleaned or corrupted original audio files, are to be ingested separately.",
